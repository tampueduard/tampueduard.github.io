Näytös23 is part of Helsinki Fashion week for which I crafted a quadraphonic live music experience.
The musical choices focused on creating an immersive experience for the public, that could follow and enrich the experience of the show. A total of seven pieces have been created for the event which featured a flow of electronic and acoustic sections, combining them in different forms, from more static and mesmerising to rythmical and minimal sections.

This production has been realized through the close collaboration with the creative director Elina Peltonen, meticulously aligning sound
design with the fashion event’s narrative and vision.

Below a list of the people that collaborated to the realization of the event and to the documentation.
