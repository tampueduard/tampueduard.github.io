            The Hidden Harmony is a multi-purpose digital synthetic system that investigates the correlation between
            colors and sounds. A set of tools that explores this multisensorial space, trying to augment our
            perception, opening new possibilities for artists and creating new experiences for viewers.
            <span>
                The concept for this project started in 2017 when I was attending my senior year of high school. The
                first
                realization was a live electronic performance based on the painting ‘Several Circles’ by Wassily
                Kandinsky.
                Realized entirely inside the Pure-data environment, in 2019 it followed an elaboration of the concept
                using
                Max/MSP.

            At this moment, The Hidden Harmony is a creative tool for artists and an installation concept that let the
            users explore the auditory dimension of a painting-image.

                artist, is the hand that plays, touching one key or another to cause vibrations in the soul. "
