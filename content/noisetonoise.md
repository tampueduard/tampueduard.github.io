The project I would like to present is mainly realized thanks to the use of GAN models. The idea is to create a space in which reality and imagination blend together through a journey between life and disintegration. The use of different stages would allow to explore the different characteristics of the learning process. How does the machine learn? From an uncertain fragile sound, noisy and unarticulated to the reminiscence of distant sounds and the imagination of the machine.

The building method would be to analyze the latent space of the first stages of the learning process, looking for sounds that could represent the birth of a GAN-synth. The use of those materials would be to decide, but mainly using some techniques that would allow me to create an immersive ambient space in which to start the introduction of new materials. The idea is to use steps that could start resembling some more complex materials, using them through a granular system for example, allowing then to create a more interesting morphing image between different layers of this first reminisces. Going further, more elements start entering the scenario, building up with the previous elements and starting the creation a more harmonic aural sensation.

To conclude, I would like to create the sensation of regression, of going back but without really returning to the first stages of the trained models. The idea is to use different techniques in order to ‘undo’ this learning curve, disintegrating the harmony that further stages had brought into the sound, trying to ‘humanize’ this curve of learning that the machine has done.

From nothing to imagination. <br> 
From imagination to reality. <br> 
From reality to deception. <br> 
From deception to disintegration.
