The concept of time has a strong influence in the development of my ideas and thoughts. In this study I elaborate on how time passes constantly how we can not perceive the flow of time, as a sensation, as an entity. 

We do not stop to understand how time and its use are the pillars on which our entire existence and the existence of our civilizations develop. A constant evolution of ourselves, as beings, and as part of a endlessly changing reality. But, are we capable of perceiving the reality changing? Are we able to perceive the passage of time? 

This study it is trying to focus our attention on these questions and the possible answers through two of the most developed dimensions within our being, vision and hearing. A series of satellite images, representing the change of the terrestrial landscape make us dwell on how much 30 years of actions of us being have intensely changed what is the reality we live in. The sound space, on the other hand, makes us perceive the constant movement of time, second by second. Incessantly regular. This perception leads us to observe how a few moments (in the sound space) are enough to define a change of our planet. How 30 years are an irreversible instant of our reality and how in our daily life, moment after moment, we do not perceive how our actions change our surroundings and impact ourself.
