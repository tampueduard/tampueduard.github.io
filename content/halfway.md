Halfway is a series of four journeys born from a series of improvisations by [Bruno Fabrizio Sorba](https://www.youtube.com/@brunofabriziosorba379/videos) (electronics) and Eduard Tampu (saxophone). A series of personal conversations that blend reality and imagination, aiming to shed light on the human psyche. 

Uncertainty, doubt, the realization that we are in constant change, and the thought that perhaps we may never truly know ourselves. 

When will this journey end?
