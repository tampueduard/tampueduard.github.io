During my residency at the UrbNet (Center for Urban Network Evolutions) at Aarhus University (DK) I had the chance to create the music and foley for an animation showcasing project MINERVA.

Together with the collaboration of Dr. Tom Brughmans, that guided me through these amazing journey, I had the chance to arrange the music and foley for this work. In its form the music tries to create a cinematic feeling to the animation, which showcases what it meant traveling through the network of the Roman Empire.

The music for the different sections has been tailored to the animation, creating movements that where emphasizing its storytelling. This has been achieved by using different organics and harmonic progressions.

The foley has been realized with a particular attention for the details of its form, spatial placement and historic context.
