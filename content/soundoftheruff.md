‘The Sound Memory of the Ruff’, realized by the visual artist [Tiina Majabacka](https://tiinamajabacka.portfoliobox.net), is a video focusing on the sensory experience related to the ruff, especially sounds. The costume in the video is like a living creature that controls and moves the person inside it. The work is an impossible attempt to reach into the past and experience historical garments and their forgotten sounds.

The sound production saw different collaborative phases with Tiina. We focused first on collecting various sonic materials from the costume. We explored ways of recording the different textures of the garments, trying also to collect the sonic properties of the ruff, taking into consideration the perspective of whom was wearing it, and trying to create a sort of intimate relationship with it through sound.

After receiving a cut of the video, we collected more tailored materials, synched to the image. Sound has not been collected on-site, due to the delicate type of sounds that the garments produced. Being really quiet materials, we wanted to have as much control of it as possible in the studio, with low noise equipment and quiet environment for recording. This also created a sort of abstraction with what the image is, alternating moments in which the foley is the main driving element, to moments in which it is absent. This gave me the possibility to work with how the sound integrated with the image and with creating a layer of storytelling that goes along with the image, but at the same time tries to tell a story of its own.
