I was responsible for the sound design of Visualizing Knowledge 2025, a conference held at Aalto University exploring the power of information design and data visualization in shaping understanding. My role was to create an auditory environment that complemented the conferenceâ€™s themes. The elaboration of sound sources coming from field recordings and sound design have been the basis for the creation thematically-driven short title motifs, connected between them through the use of the 'VK25' morse code. A longer track has been produced as brake music, which encloses all the elements into a more soothing sound serving the purpose of background.
