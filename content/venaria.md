This project is a collaboration with ROOM and Club Silenction realized through NOVA Media Studio. Together with Federica Sorba we studied the space of the Great Gallery of Venaria Reale in which the event was taking place. We created a fluid and dynamic visuals which were driven both by the live string quartet *Archeia* and live performed. Moreover, the event was alternating the string quartet with live music that I designed and performed. Below a short video from the event showcases how the event looked in the context of the event that took place on July 13, 2024. A video with one of the pieces that I realized for the event is also shown.
