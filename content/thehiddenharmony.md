The Hidden Harmony is a multi-purpose digital synthetic system that investigates the correlation between colors and sounds. 

The concept for this project started in 2017 when I was attending my senior year of high school. The first realization was a live electronic performance based on the painting ‘Several Circles’ by Wassily Kandinsky. Realized entirely inside the Pure-data environment, in 2019 it followed an elaboration of the concept using Max/MSP. 

In 2023 I had the opportunity to showcase this project as part of Sònar+D project area in Barcellona, Spain.

In time this relationship has been studied with more than one theory. From Greeks with Aristotle (On Colours) , to Isaac Newton (Opticks) and many other artists like Wassily Kandinsky (On the Spiritual in Art) and Alexander Skrjabin (Prometheus: The Poem of Fire), have explored this correlation in their artworks. Following these routes, The Hidden Harmony is a set of tools that explores this multisensorial space, trying to augment our perception, opening new possibilities for artists and creating new experiences for viewers.

At this moment, The Hidden Harmony is a creative tool for artists (as a Max4Live device) and an installation concept that let the users explore the auditory dimension of a painting-image.

You can find the Max4Live devices and more about this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/tampueduard/study003-the-hidden-harmony). An overview of its application and installation concept can be found [here](../content/thehiddenharmony.pdf).
