Paradosso is an exploration of the interplay between sound, space, and performance. Blurring the lines between composition and environment, this electroacoustic piece for alto saxophone, live electronics, and active acoustics enhancement transforms the act of listening into a dynamic, immersive experience.

Through the use of Regenerative Active Acoustic Enhancement systems, Paradosso engages with its surroundings, making the performance site an active participant in the creative process. The result is a constantly evolving dialogue between performer and the environment, exploring the notion of music and space. Listen as sound shapes space—and space shapes sound.

This work is the culmination of my MA thesis in Sound in New Media at Aalto University (FI), made possible through the support of the Aalto Acoustics Lab. Their funding and access to cutting-edge Active Acoustic Enhancement technology were instrumental in bringing this project to life.

For centuries, the acoustic properties of spaces have shaped the sounds produced within them. Concert halls, places of worship, and unconventional venues not only influenced the creation of music but were, in turn, shaped by it. This reciprocal relationship created a deep connection between composers, musicians, and the environments that host their art.

Technological advancements allowed for multichannel audio techniques used both for the spatial distribution of sound sources and for altering the perceived spatial quality of the physical room. Introduced in the 1960s, Active Acoustic Enhancement systems (AAEs) use electroacoustic chains—microphones, a digital signal processor (DSP), and loudspeakers to control and manipulate the acoustic character of a physical space in real-time. These systems can change the perceived acoustic qualities and enhance reverberation conditions in a physical space. Two main types of AAEs exist: in-line or regenerative. The first method uses microphones close to the source to capture mainly the direct component of the sound source, while the latter employs microphones distributed around the room to capture and enhance the acoustic properties of the physical space.

This research focuses on investigating (1) the use of Active Acoustics Enhancement in electroacoustic music by (2) shaping different perceived acoustics, with (3) the intention of investigating the influence of space on the compositional and performative aspects.

For more about the research you can find other audio examples in the [GitHub](https://github.com/tampueduard/artisticActiveAcousticEnhancement) repository of the thesis.
